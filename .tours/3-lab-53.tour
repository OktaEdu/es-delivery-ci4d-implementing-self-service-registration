Click `Edit` to open the code editor for the Email Factor Verification template.\n   For your convenience, we've added an editable copy of the default HTML code used to generate the Email Factor Verification emails here in this VSCode workspace. It's called `default-email-template.html`\n\n2. Examine the line above the comment. This generates the salutation.\n   Notice that it references the profile attribute `user.profile.firstName`\n\n3. Recall that we've updated the Default User Profile so that customers do not have to provide a first name. This means the email generated will look like:\n\n`Hi , `\n\nThis doesn't look very professional at all, so let's fix this by greeting the user by their `login` (username) instead.",
